# Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sasha Sushko

I'm a front-end developer with 7 years of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js and Next.js. Mentor and altruist: now I'm helping to translate MDN Web Docs into Russian; in the past I was the mentor in Google Summer of Code program and was an open source contributor.
